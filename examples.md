# Beginner Transcript — Reverse Words Example

**Student (goal + code):**  
> I want to reverse the order of words in a string but the output is wrong.

```py
def reverse_words(s):
    words = s.split(' ')
    for i in range(len(words)):
        words[i] = words[len(words) - i]
    return ' '.join(words)



Assistant (structured response):

Acknowledgment: You want to reverse the order of words in a string.

Quick summary: Possible IndexError / off-by-one in the loop indexing.

Top likely causes:

Off-by-one index when using len(words) - i.

Edge-case when splitting on ' ' (multiple spaces / empty string).

Why each causes the symptom:

len(words) - i equals len(words) when i == 0 — that index is out of range (valid indices are 0..len(words)-1).

Using ' ' as the split delimiter can produce empty strings in the list when extra spaces exist, which may behave unexpectedly.

Concrete diagnostic steps:

Add print(len(words), words) before the loop.

Inside the loop add print(i, len(words)-i) to see the indexes being used.

Run the function on "one two" and "".

Progressive hints:

L1 (conceptual): What are valid list indices for a list of length n?

L2 (targeted): What is len(words)-i when i == 0? Print it.

L3 (very specific, only if asked): Single-line hint: words[i] = words[len(words)-1-i].

Test cases to try: "", "hello", "one two three".

One-line style note: Consider using s.split() (no argument) to handle variable whitespace.

Follow-up prompt: Try those prints and paste what you get — which hint level would you like next?





# Advanced Transcript — Frequency Count Example

**Student (goal + code):**  
> I want a function that returns counts of each element in a list. It fails on the first run.

```py
def unique_counts(arr):
    counts = {}
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1
    return counts



Assistant (structured response):

Acknowledgment: You want frequency counts of elements in an array.

Quick summary: KeyError when encountering the first occurrence of a new key.

Top likely causes:

Using counts[x] += 1 before the key exists in counts.

Elements in arr may be unhashable (e.g., lists), causing TypeError.

Why each causes the symptom:

Accessing counts[x] for a key not yet present raises KeyError.

Non-hashable types (like lists) cannot be dictionary keys and will raise TypeError.

Concrete diagnostic steps:

Print type(x) and repr(x) for the first few iterations.

Run the function with [1,1,2] and with [[1],[1]] to check behavior.

Progressive hints:

L1 (conceptual): Ensure keys are hashable and are initialized before incrementing.

L2 (targeted): Inspect arr[:5] and type(x) for the first elements.

L3 (very specific, only if asked): Single-line hint: counts[x] = counts.get(x, 0) + 1.

Test cases to try: [], [1,1,2], [[1],[1]] (to reveal unhashable types).

One-line style note: For large datasets consider collections.Counter or streaming approaches to limit memory usage.

Follow-up prompt: Run these checks and paste the output; ask for L3 only after you've tried L1/L2.
