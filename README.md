# py-debug-hint-engine
An optimized AI prompt for Python debugging assistance that guides students through systematic problem-solving while preventing direct solution reveals. Features progressive hints, concrete diagnostics, and educational safeguards.
# Python Debug Tutor - AI Assistant Prompt

A research-backed AI prompt engineered to create educational debugging assistance that prioritizes student learning over quick fixes. This single, optimized prompt transforms AI assistants into patient tutors that guide students through systematic problem-solving.

## 🎯 Purpose

Turn any AI assistant into an educational debugging tutor that:
- **Guides discovery** instead of giving solutions
- **Builds debugging skills** through systematic approach  
- **Maintains engagement** with encouraging, structured feedback
- **Prevents solution dependency** through progressive hint system

## 🔧 The Prompt

The repository contains one carefully engineered prompt that creates:

- **9-point structured responses** for consistency
- **Progressive hint system** (L1 → L2 → L3) with student control
- **Hard solution prevention** with explicit confirmation requirements
- **Concrete diagnostic steps** students can immediately execute
- **Adaptive guidance** for different skill levels

##  Why This Design Works

✅ **Systematic Structure** - 9 mandatory sections ensure nothing is missed  
✅ **Solution Prevention** - Requires explicit student confirmation to reveal answers  
✅ **Educational Focus** - Patient, encouraging persona with learning-first approach  
✅ **Practical Implementation** - Clear constraints and concrete examples  
✅ **Student Agency** - Progressive hints give learners control over help level  

## 🚀 Quick Implementation

1. **Copy the prompt** from `python-debug-tutor-prompt.md`
2. **Deploy with any AI model** (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. **Customize skill level handling** for your student population
4. **Monitor and iterate** based on student feedback

## 📊 Designed For

- **EdTech platforms** building AI tutoring systems
- **Educational institutions** using AI teaching assistants  
- **Coding bootcamps** providing debugging support
- **Online learning platforms** with programming courses
- **Individual educators** enhancing their AI tools

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Based on synthesis of:
- **Constructivist Learning Theory** - Students learn by discovering
- **Cognitive Load Management** - Structured, progressive information delivery
- **Educational AI Ethics** - Preserving learning integrity while providing support
- **Prompt Engineering Best Practices** - Systematic constraint enforcement

## 🤝 Usage Examples

The repository includes real-world scenarios showing how the prompt handles:
- Syntax errors for beginners
- Logic bugs for intermediate students  
- Complex algorithmic issues for advanced learners
- Edge cases and error handling

## 📚 What You Get

- **The optimized prompt** (ready to deploy)
- **Implementation guide** with customization tips
- **Usage examples** across skill levels
- **Design rationale** and research background
- **Testing scenarios** for validation

Perfect for anyone building educational AI that needs to **teach** debugging skills rather than just **fix** bugs.
